# Saper game

A classic single-player computer game. 

The game consists of exploring the various boxes on the board in such a way as to avoid encountering a mine. On each exposed field is written the number of mines that are directly in contact with the field (from zero to eight). If you mark a field with a flag, it is protected from being exposed so that you do not accidentally expose a mine.
